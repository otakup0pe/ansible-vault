# A Ansible Vault Role

I've been using [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for what feels like almost a decade now. There have even been times when I have contributed, albeit in small ways, to the project. Then there are projects like [`aomi`](https://autodesk.github.io/aomi/) and [`hcvswitch`](https://github.com/otakup0pe/hcvswitch), let alone all the closed source nonsense I've gotten up to.

I use this here pile of YAML

* Provisioning a UNIX-ish workstation for doing Vault adjacent development
* Running local Vault containers to aid in development
* Running as a server in a container or local daemon
